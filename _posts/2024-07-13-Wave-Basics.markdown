# Wave Equation

The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves. The general form of the wave equation is given by

$$ \nabla^2 \psi = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} $$

where $$v$$ is the speed of the wave and $$\psi$$ is the wave function. $$\nabla$$ is the Laplacian operator.

- Laplacian in Rectangular Coordinates

  $$ \nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} $$

  where $$x, y, z$$ are the spatial coordinates as shown in the figure below:
