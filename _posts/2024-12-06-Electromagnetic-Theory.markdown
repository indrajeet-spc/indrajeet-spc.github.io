# Maxwell Equations:

Maxwell’s equations are the basic equations of electromagnetism which are a collection of Gauss’s law for electricity, Gauss’s law for magnetism, Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, and Ampere’s law for currents in conductors.


### Maxwell's first equation
The first equation is based on the ==Gauss's law== of electricity.

>*"The flux passing through any closed surface is equal to $$ \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0} $$ times the total charge enclosed by that surface."*

 $$ \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds} = \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}q $$ 
 
It is the integral form of Maxwell's first equation.

The total charge in terms of volume charge density is given by

$$ q=\int \rho dv $$

Above two equations gives

$$\int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds} = \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}\int \rho dv $$

\begin{align*}
a & = b \\
X &\sim {\sf Norm}(10, 3) \\
5 & \le 10
\end{align*}
