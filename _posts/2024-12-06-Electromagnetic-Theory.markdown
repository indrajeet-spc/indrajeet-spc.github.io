# Maxwell Equations:

Maxwell’s equations are the basic equations of electromagnetism which are a collection of Gauss’s law for electricity, Gauss’s law for magnetism, Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, and Ampere’s law for currents in conductors.


## Maxwell's first equation
The first equation is based on the Gauss's law of electricity.\\
"The flux passing through any closed surface is equal to $ \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0} $ times the total charge enclosed by that surface." $ i.e. $
 $$ \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds} = \dfrac{1}{\epsilon_0}q $$ 
It is the integral form of Maxwell's first equation.
